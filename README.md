# OmniFlicks
OmniFlicks is in development as a web app project for a data science grad course. The intention is to pull in movie data sets from across streaming services and movie ratings websites to combine, preprocess, and normalize text, extract features using TF-IDF, and run the features through a sentiment analysis algorithm to train a movie recommendation engine.

The web app would allow for user input via various parameters and filtering as well as the ability for a user to rate movies in the app with the output being movie recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. Without user ratings it would initially provide recommendations based on search criteria and item-based analysis.

There are two databases I have in mind to pull in movie data via APIs:

[OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) and [Streaming Availability API](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/)

The initial build of the web app pulls data from [Movie Recommendation System](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohitshirudkar/movie-recommendation-system/data) via [Kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com).


All film metadata used in **OmniFlicks** even from the Kaggle.com dataset comes from The Movie Database (TMDb).

**OmniFlicks** is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
