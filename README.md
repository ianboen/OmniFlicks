# OmniFlicks
OmniFlicks is in development as a web app project for a data science grad course. The intention is to pull in movie data sets from across streaming services and movie ratings websites to combine, preprocess, and normalize text, extract features using TF-IDF, and run the features through a sentiment analysis algorithm to train a movie recommendation engine.

The web app would allow for user input via various parameters and filtering as well as the ability for a user to rate movies in the app with the output being movie recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. Without user ratings it would initially provide recommendations based on search criteria and item-based analysis.

There are two databases the application uses to pull in movie data:

[OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) and [Streaming Availability API](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/)
